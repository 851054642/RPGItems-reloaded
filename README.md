## Status

The develop branch is `1.13.2` version 3.7.

The main branch is `1.13.2` version 3.6 and is *in beta*. It *should* be fully compatible with **Spigot/Paper 1.13.2**.

The stable branch is `1.11` version 3.5 compatibles with **Spigot 1.11 ~ 1.12.x** and the work is focused on fixing bugs and compatibility issues resolving. It *will not* port to 1.13 but it should work (with some minor issue).  
Old branches (1.7 ~ 1.10, 1.12, 1.13, 1.13.1) are no longer maintained.  
Critical bug fix (e.g. item duplication) may be backported upon request (by opening a issue).  
Backport PR is welcomed.

All builds can be found in the [Releases Page](https://github.com/NyaaCat/RPGItems-reloaded/releases).
Please choose builds with prefixes matching your server version.

Some version of this plugin use code from [NBT API](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/item-entity-tile-nbt-api.7939/) internally.

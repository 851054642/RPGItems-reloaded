# RPGitems Reloaded [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/NyaaCat/RPGitems-reloaded.svg?branch=1.11.2)](https://travis-ci.org/NyaaCat/RPGitems-reloaded)

The RPGitems2 plugin continued from [TheCreeperOfRedstone/RPG-Items-2](https://github.com/TheCreeperOfRedstone/RPG-Items-2)

**RPGitem 3.6 now depends on [NyaaCore](https://github.com/NyaaCat/NyaaCore) to work!**

The development branch is `1.12.1` version 3.6 and is in *earlier development stage*. 

The stable branch is `1.11` version 3.5 and the work is focused on fixing bugs and compatibility issues resolving.  
Old branches (1.7~1.10) are no longer maintained.  
Critical bug fix (e.g. item duplication) may be backported upon request (by opening a issue).

All builds can be found in the [Releases Page](https://github.com/NyaaCat/RPGitems-reloaded/releases).  
Please choose builds with prefixes matching your server version.

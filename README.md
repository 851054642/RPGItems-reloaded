# RPGitems Reloaded [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/NyaaCat/RPGitems-reloaded.svg?branch=1.11.2)](https://travis-ci.org/NyaaCat/RPGitems-reloaded)

The RPGitems2 plugin continued from [TheCreeperOfRedstone/RPG-Items-2](https://github.com/TheCreeperOfRedstone/RPG-Items-2)

**RPGitem 3.6 now depends on [NyaaCore](https://github.com/NyaaCat/NyaaCore) to work!**

The development branch is `1.13` version 3.6 and is *in development*. It *should* be fully compatible with 1.13.

The stable branch is `1.11` version 3.5 compatibles with spigot 1.11~1.12.x and the work is focused on fixing bugs and compatibility issues resolving. It *will not* port to 1.13 but it should work (with a little stacktrace).
Old branches (1.7~1.10) are no longer maintained.  
Critical bug fix (e.g. item duplication) may be backported upon request (by opening a issue).
Backport PR is welcomed.

All builds can be found in the [Releases Page](https://github.com/NyaaCat/RPGitems-reloaded/releases).  
Please choose builds with prefixes matching your server version.

This plugin use code from [NBT API](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/item-entity-tile-nbt-api.7939/) internally.
